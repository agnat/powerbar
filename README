Compiling the code:
===================
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../powerbar/toolchain-avr-gcc.cmake  ../powerbar
make
make upload_powerbar

Fuse bits:
====================================
low fuse:  0xef
high fuse: 0xd9

Common lantronix device settings:
=================================

Configurable Pins:
    CP0: GPIO (unused)
    CP1: Modem Control Out (DCD)
    CP2: Modem Control In  (DTR)

Connection:
    Disconnect Mode: on DTR

    Baudrate: 38400

Errata for rev. 0.1
===================
    - GPIO is not connected to WiPort; Connection management does not work
    - terminals on relay board have wrong orientation


TODOs for revision 0.2:
=======================
    - GPIO should be named DTR
    - old DTR should be named DCD
    - DCD should be connected to INT0 or INT1
    - rotate WiPort footprint
    - rotate terminals on relay board
    - move more SMD parts to the top side
    - narrow boards by approx. 0.5mm
    - make COM_RST pull-up a pull-down
